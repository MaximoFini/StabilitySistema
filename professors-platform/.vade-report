# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented Vercel Speed Insights for the professors-platform React application following the official Vercel documentation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed Dependencies
- Added `@vercel/speed-insights` package (v1.3.1) to the project dependencies
- Updated package-lock.json to reflect the new dependency and its transitive dependencies

### 2. Modified Files
- **src/App.tsx**: Added SpeedInsights component integration
  - Imported `SpeedInsights` from `@vercel/speed-insights/react`
  - Added `<SpeedInsights />` component alongside the existing `<Analytics />` component

### Implementation Details
The SpeedInsights component was added to the root App component, which ensures it tracks performance metrics across all routes in the application. This follows the recommended pattern for React applications using React Router.

The implementation is consistent with the existing code structure:
- Placed next to the existing Vercel Analytics component for logical grouping
- Uses the same import pattern as other Vercel packages
- Maintains the existing JSX structure and formatting

### Verification
- ✅ Build completed successfully without errors
- ✅ No new linting errors introduced
- ✅ Package installation completed successfully
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful

## Next Steps for Deployment
To complete the Speed Insights setup, the following steps need to be performed in the Vercel dashboard:
1. Enable Speed Insights in the project settings
2. Deploy the application to Vercel
3. Verify the `/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js` script is loaded
4. View metrics in the Speed Insights dashboard after users visit the site

## Technical Notes
- This is a React + TypeScript + Vite project
- The project already had Vercel Analytics configured, making the Speed Insights addition straightforward
- Speed Insights will automatically track Core Web Vitals and other performance metrics
- The component is framework-aware and optimized for React applications
